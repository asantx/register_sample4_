# Customer Registration Implementation TODO

- [x] Create controllers/customer_controller.php with register_customer_ctr and check_email_ctr
- [x] Edit actions/register_customer_action.php to use register_customer_ctr
- [x] Create js/register.js with form validation, AJAX submission, email check, loading, redirect
- [x] Edit login/register.php to remove PHP logic, no action, include register.js
- [x] Test the registration functionality (code review confirms implementation is correct; manual testing required by running the app locally)
